The VTEX Affiliates Order Form Spy app is responsible for getting the checkout email and monitoring the order form, sending the email information for the Affiliates main app to use on the order flow.

These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the running project on your local machine for the purposes of querying the vtex api and integrating with app **Affiliates Order Form Spy**.

## üîß Installation

To start the installation, you need to clone the GitLab project into a directory of your choice:

  (by default, we use jira task number vtex000 without spaces and hyphen).
```

  (which would be your ws id)
```
